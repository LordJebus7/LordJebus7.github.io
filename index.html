<hr>
<pre>
This is simply a website that i've decided to create and to start working on<br>
whenever i have some free time and i'm unsure as to what i should do with it.<br>
I started to learn HTML and CSS in year 9. However, i've forgotten almost everything<br>
that i've learnt from that time and i am trying to rebuild my knowledge.
