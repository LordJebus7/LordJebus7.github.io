<h2>What is this website?</h2>

<p>
This is simply a website that i've decided to create and to start working on<br>
whenever i have some free time and i'm unsure as to what i should do with it.<br>
I started to learn <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 
and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> in year 9. However, i've forgotten almost everything<br>
that i've learnt from that time and i am trying to rebuild my knowledge.

    - Learn more about C++<br>
    - Attain my drivers license<br>
